# This is an R script. 
# Sometimes you don't need a full report, so you don't need a .Rmd
# Put your answers in this .R file, name it InClassDay5_Yourlastname.R and
# save/commit/push as usual
# turn the repository in on Blackboard when you're done. 
# The code should be able to run on my machine with no errors. (I will check!)

# Make the `now_doing` variable upper case

# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to 
# variables `fav_1` and `fav_2`

# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save the new value in the
# original variable

# Create a variable `raw_sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the 
# `sum()` function for practice.

# Create a variable `round_sum` that is the `raw_sum` rounded to 2 decimal places.
# Use the `round()` function.

# Create two new variables `round_1` and `round_2` that are your `fav_1` and 
# `fav_2` variables rounded to 2 decimal places

# Create a variable `sum_round` that is the sum of the rounded values

# Print out both variables and compare. Are they the same?
